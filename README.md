# ThePantryPuzzle
    Our Project Idea: Our project idea mainly focuses on recommending and finding different recipes for the user as they enter the ingredients
    they have. Users can be divided into 2 categories: chef (recipes provider), and customer (the one searching for the recipes). Chefs can add
    whatever recipes they want and gain insights about how well a recipe is from the customer trials. In addition to adding ingredients and recipe
    searching, customers can provide reviews and ratings for each recipe. Moreover, customers can share the results of each recipe with the
    community.

# Technical Approach
    Project Setup (MPA):
    Multi-Page Application: it is SEO friendly, compatible with a wider range of web browsers, a more straightforward development process.
    Front-end: Vanilla JavaScript
    Back-end: Flask
    Database: to store the scraped recipe data (SQL databases)

# Risk Mitigation 
    How users respond is a great risk to our business, as our service is built upon users interacting and rating each other’s recipes. 
    The main concern is that other users review bombing chefs' recipes they don't like, which could be avoided 
    by verifying reviews before posting them through a captcha verification system.
